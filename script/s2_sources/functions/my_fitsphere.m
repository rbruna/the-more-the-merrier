function [ center, radius ] = my_fitsphere ( points )

% FITSPHERE fits the centre and radius of a sphere to a set of points
% using Taubin's method.
%
% Use as
%       [center,radius] = fitsphere(points)
% where
%   points  = Nx3 matrix with the Carthesian coordinates of the surface points
% and
%   center  = the center of the fitted sphere
%   radius  = the radius of the fitted sphere
